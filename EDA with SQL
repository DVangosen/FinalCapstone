Task 1: Display the names of the unique launch sites in the space mission

SELECT UNIQUE Launch_Site FROM SPACEXTBL;

Task 2: Display 5 records where launch sites begin with the string 'CCA'

SELECT Launch_Site
FROM SPACEXTBL 
WHERE Launch_Site LIKE 'CCA%' 
LIMIT 5;

Task 3: Display the total payload mass carried by boosters launched by NASA (CRS)

SELECT SUM(PAYLOAD_MASS__KG_)
FROM SPACEXTBL; 

Task 4: Display average payload mass carried by booster version F9 v1.1

SELECT AVG(PAYLOAD_MASS__KG_)
FROM SPACEXTBL
WHERE BOOSTER_VERSION='F9 v1.1'; 

Task 5: List the date when the first successful landing outcome in ground pad was acheived. 

SELECT MIN(DATE)
FROM SPACEXTBL
WHERE LANDING__OUTCOME='Success';

Task 6: List the names of the boosters which have success in drone ship and have payload mass greater than 4000 but less than 6000

SELECT BOOSTER_VERSION
FROM SPACEXTBL 
WHERE (mission_outcome like 'Success')
AND (payload_mass__kg_ BETWEEN 4000 AND 6000) 
AND (landing__outcome like 'Success (drone ship)');

Task 7: List the total number of successful and failure mission outcomes

SELECT mission_outcome, count(*) as Count FROM SPACEXTBL 
GROUP by mission_outcome 
ORDER BY mission_outcome;

Task 8: List the names of the booster_versions which have carried the maximum payload mass. Use a subquery

SELECT booster_version FROM SPACEXTBL WHERE 
payload_mass__kg_=(SELECT MAX(payload_mass__kg_) FROM SPACEXTBL);

Task 9: List the failed landing_outcomes in drone ship, their booster versions, and launch site names for in year 2015

select MONTHNAME(DATE) as Month, landing__outcome, booster_version, launch_site
from SPACEXTBL where DATE like '2015%' AND landing__outcome 
like 'Failure (drone ship)';

Task 10: Rank the count of landing outcomes (such as Failure (drone ship) or Success (ground pad)) between the date 2010-06-04 and 2017-03-20, in descending order

select landing__outcome, count(*) as count from SPACEXTBL
where Date >= '2010-06-04' AND Date <= '2017-03-20'
GROUP by landing__outcome ORDER BY count Desc;
